		<p>I am a senior business analytics and information systems major, also pursuing a creative writing certificate from the Magid Center through the publishing track at the University of Iowa. </p>

		<p>My writing has been published in multiple student publications, including Horizon and Sanct Literary Magazine. I have also been an art editor for the first issue of Zenith Magazine, and a section Editor for a local student Anthology. Currently, I am an editor for the 6th annual Iowa Chapbook Prize.</p>

		<p>Aside from my creative feats, I have also worked on various group projects utilizing R Studio, SQL, and Python. Most recently, my teams have generated an in-depth analysis on features of houses in Ames which have the largest impacts on price, and I am currently working with a health insurance company to pinpoint consumer features which have a lasting impact on health in order to match them with the most beneficial insurance claim.</p>
